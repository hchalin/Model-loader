#Project notes:

Controller branch:
    There is a problem with updating the uniform buffer when moving the camera around.
    I have created a get uniform buffer to update the contents of it. Right now, my
    intuition is telling me there is a problem with using the 'didModifyRange()' fn.
    It may not be actually updating the contents of the uniform buffer?  In some instances
    the uniform buffer is a nullptr, even after being set (tested) in the constructor.
