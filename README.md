# Model Loader (metal-cpp)

A lightweight **3D model loader and renderer** built with [metal-cpp](https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/), Apple‚Äôs C++ interface for the Metal graphics API.  
This is my first graphics engineering project ‚Äî aimed at learning modern rendering pipelines while keeping everything in pure C++.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Written entirely in **C++20** with [metal-cpp](https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/) (no Objective-C required).
- Loads and renders 3D models with vertex data and basic materials.
- Implements a clean separation of concerns:  
  - `Window` ‚Äì window/context creation (GLFW-backed).  
  - `Renderer` ‚Äì manages pipelines, command encoding, and drawing.  
  - `Model` ‚Äì loads and stores mesh data.  
  - `Camera` ‚Äì view & projection handling.  
  - `Transform` ‚Äì reusable math for positions, rotations, scaling.
- Extensible design ‚Äî built so you can plug in more features like lighting, animations, or instancing.
